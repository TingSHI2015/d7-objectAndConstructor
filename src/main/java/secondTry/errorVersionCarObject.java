//Ting: In Java, you can't directly assign values to instance variables outside of a method or constructor.
// In your carObjects-errorVersion class, you are trying to assign values to the brand and model variables directly inside the class body, which is not allowed!!!
// Instead, you should do this inside a method or a constructor!!!!!
//falsch!           carObjects1.brand = "BMW";
//falsch!           carObjects1.model = "Model1";
